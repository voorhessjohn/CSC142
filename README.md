# CSC142 Assignment Two
I am supposed to adapt my code from Assignment One to incorporate movement into MountainScene with movement functions from the uwcse graphics library.  As of this commit, nothing moves and when the individual movement methods are initialized in the public constructor of each class, only a single tree appears on the screen.

I have used moveBy() as a stand-in for each movement function for testing.  I was just trying to get something to work before adapting and implementing changes to bring it to the assignment standard.
